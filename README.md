* Click and drag mouse to move song panel around

**Notes:**
* You can now use keyboard and headphone media keys to control the program (even while minimized)
* For headphones with one media button the controls are usually: double-click = next song, tripple-click = prev song, single-click = play/pause
* Only capable of playing songs added to Osu! collections at this time.
* Osu! saves to its "Collections" file when you close the game.
