# Osu-MP3
Play Songs From Your Osu! Directory!

![GitHub Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Supernova1114/Osu-MP3)
 
*Make sure to place the jar file into a folder somewhere and make a desktop shortcut because the program creates two files. 
You probably would not want it to create the files on your desktop so I highly recommend this!*

**!!Only able to play songs from Collections at this time!!**

**!!Has only been tested on Windows 10!!**

**How to use:**
* go to (File > Get Osu! Folder) and select your Osu! folder (not songs folder)
* the number of songs imported will be shown in the top right
* click a song name to begin playing a shuffled playlist of the selected collection (column)

**Controls:**
* up/down arrow for volume
* keyboard and headphone media keys for audio playback
* drag mouse to move song panel around

**Notes:**
* you can now use keyboard and headphone media keys to control the program (even while minimized)
* for headphones with one media button the controls are usually: double-click = next song, tripple-click = prev song, single-click = play/pause
* Osu! saves to its "Collections" file when you close the game.

Uses library: https://github.com/tulskiy/jkeymaster for media keystrokes
