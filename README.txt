# Osu-MP3
 Play Songs From Your Osu! Directory!

!!Only able to play songs from Collections at this time!!

-you can now play the next and prev songs in a playlist
-you can now use keyboard media keys to control the program
-you can control the program with media keys even when it is minimized
-you can use media keys on your headphones to control program (and earbuds double tap to go next track, tripple tap to go prev track like normally)
-It can now remember where your osu folder is so you dont have to input it everytime
-It now remembers the locations of the song files in order to startup quickly, and will only reload the songs into the program once a song is added or removed from an osu collection

*Make sure to place the jar file into a folder somewhere and make a desktop shortcut because the program creates two file. You probably would not want it to create the files on your desktop so I highly recommend this
